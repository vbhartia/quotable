["A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences.

["It's hard to tell with these Internet startups if they're really interested in building companies or if they're just interested in the money.

What will it be able to do ten or 20 years from now, or 50 years from now?", "Steve Jobs"],

["The over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology, but it will date it. By definition. Eventually, it will replace it. But it's like people who had black-and-white TVs when color came out. They eventually decided whether or not the new technology was worth the investment.", "Steve Jobs"],
